### Understanding the For You Timeline on X
The "For You" timeline on X (formerly Twitter) is an algorithmic feed that shows a mix of posts from accounts you follow (about 50%) and recommended content from accounts you don't (the other 50%). It's designed to surface engaging or relevant posts based on your interactions, like likes, retweets, searches, and topics X infers from your activity. However, this can lead to clutter from ads, unwanted topics, or repetitive content. Cleaning it up involves training the algorithm, curating your follows, and using built-in tools to filter or reset recommendations. Changes may take a few days to fully take effect as the algorithm adjusts.

### Steps to Clean Up Your For You Timeline
Here are practical, step-by-step methods based on X's features and user-recommended tips. Start with the simplest ones and work your way down for a deeper clean.

1. **Switch to the Following Timeline for a Chronological View**  
   The easiest quick fix is to avoid the algorithm altogether. At the top of your home screen, tap the tabs to switch from "For You" to "Following." This shows only posts from accounts you follow, in reverse chronological order—no recommendations or ads mixed in. You can toggle back anytime. To make "Following" your default:  
   - On mobile: Long-press the home icon in the bottom navigation and select "Following."  
   - On desktop: Click the sparkle icon (top right) to switch and pin it.  
   This won't "clean" For You but gives you control over what you see immediately.

2. **Mark Unwanted Posts as "Not Interested"**  
   When you see irrelevant recommendations in For You:  
   - Tap the three-dot menu (⋯) on the post.  
   - Select "Not interested in this post" or "Show fewer posts from [account]."  
   Do this for 10–20 similar posts, and X will reduce that type of content over time. It's like negative feedback to refine the algorithm. For example, if politics or specific trends dominate, mark them repeatedly.

3. **Unfollow or Mute Accounts You No Longer Want**  
   Review who you follow to eliminate sources of unwanted noise:  
   - Go to your profile > "Following" (shows a list of accounts).  
   - Click an account > three-dot menu > "Unfollow."  
   Prioritize inactive accounts (no posts in months), bots, or those posting off-topic content. Aim to unfollow 50–100 if your list is bloated (X limits mass unfollows to avoid spam flags).  
   Alternatively, mute without unfollowing:  
   - From their profile: Three-dot menu > "Mute @username
."  
   This hides their posts from your timeline and notifications without them knowing. Great for family or colleagues you don't want to unfollow outright.  
   Pro tip: Use X Lists (see below) to organize follows without cluttering your main timeline.

4. **Mute Words, Phrases, and Topics**  
   Filter out specific keywords or themes:  
   - Go to Settings and privacy > Privacy and safety > Mute and block > Muted words.  
   - Add terms like "politics," "crypto," or "#ad
" (include variations, e.g., "election" OR "vote").  
   - Toggle on "Home timeline" and set duration (e.g., forever or 7 days). You can also limit to non-followed accounts.  
   For broader topics:  
   - Settings and privacy > Privacy and safety > Content you see > Interests (or Topics).  
   - Review suggested topics and tap the "X" next to ones you don't want (e.g., sports, news categories). This adds them to a "Not interested" list, reducing related recommendations. You can only dismiss ~50 at a time due to rate limits, but repeat as needed.  
   Muting applies to For You and protects your mentions too.

5. **Clear Your Search and Interaction History to Reset the Algorithm**  
   The algorithm learns from your searches, likes, and views, so wiping this gives it a "fresh start":  
   - For search history: Go to the search bar > Recent searches > Clear all.  
   - Unlike old posts: Go to Likes tab on your profile > three-dot menu on a like > Unlike. Bulk-unlike via desktop or third-party tools (see below).  
   - Clear other history: Settings and privacy > Your account > Download an archive of your data (to back up first), then delete old likes, retweets, and replies manually.  
   Avoid liking or engaging with unwanted content going forward. Users report it takes 1–2 weeks for noticeable improvements, but this effectively resets recommendations.

6. **Use X Lists for a Curated Feed**  
   Create custom timelines without altering your main follows:  
   - Go to Lists (in the side menu) > Create new list.  
   - Add accounts you want to see together (e.g., "News Only" or "Friends").  
   - Pin the list to your home screen for quick access.  
   Lists show chronological posts from those accounts only, bypassing For You clutter. It's a free, built-in way to organize and "clean" what you see.

7. **Block Spam Accounts and Report Issues**  
   For bots or harassers polluting recommendations:  
   - On their post/profile: Three-dot menu > Block @username
.  
   - Or Report > "It's spam" or "Irrelevant."  
   Blocking removes them from suggestions. Also, in Settings > Notifications > Filters, enable "Quality filter" and "Muted notifications" to hide low-quality content.

8. **Advanced: Bulk Delete Old Tweets, Likes, and Followers (Optional Deep Clean)**  
   If your past activity is training bad recommendations:  
   - Download your X archive (Settings > Your account > Download an archive).  
   - Use official partners like TweetDelete or TweetEraser (free tiers available) to bulk-delete old tweets, likes, or retweets by date/keyword. This clears your profile and can indirectly improve For You by removing outdated signals. Note: X API limits deletions, so it may take time.  
   For followers: Manually remove fakes via your Followers list > three-dot menu > Remove this follower. Tools like Circleboom can help identify and mass-remove inactive ones.

### Additional Tips
- **Be Patient and Consistent**: Engage only with content you want more of (likes, replies). Avoid clicking on unwanted posts, as it signals interest.
- **No Official Reset Button**: X doesn't have a one-click algorithm reset, but the above mimics it. Some users suggest deactivating/reactivating your account briefly, but this risks losing data—avoid unless necessary.
- **Privacy Boost**: In Settings > Privacy and safety > Discoverability, turn off "Suggest your account" and location sharing to reduce irrelevant suggestions.
- **If It's Ads**: For You prioritizes promoted content; mute keywords like "sponsored" or upgrade to X Premium for fewer ads (details at https://help.x.com/en/using-x/x-premium
).
- **Limitations**: Changes aren't instant, and X's algorithm is proprietary—open-sourcing parts hasn't fully demystified it. If issues persist, check X's help center or contact support.

Following these steps should make your For You timeline more relevant and less overwhelming. Start with switching to Following and marking not interested for quick wins!
